How to use Git  (Basic commands)
===============================

Intro:
-----
There are only 4 basic commands you have to know to use git on you local machine.
init, 'status',  'add', 'commit -m' and 'log'

1.)	Before you start working on your files you have to initialize git
	in the working directory.
	
	'git init'

2.)	Then you can start working by creating files, writing some text and making
	changes. Where you are ready you should add the files you have worked on.
	
	'git add [filename.txt]'
	
	Or you could just add all files you created by:
	
	'git add .'
	
3.)	Some times you need to check the status by:

	'git status'
	
	Read the output on you CLI

4.)	Where you are ready to make your first commit to git ( version control system )
	use:
	
	'git commit -m "Your first commit"'

5.)	Now you can repeat steps 2 and  4 every time you made some changes and want to
	keep track of all you changes. Don't forget to check your status: Step 3.
	
6.)	If you want you list the history of all commits ie. changes you have made, use:

	'git log'
	
	Exit the log by using
	
	'q'
